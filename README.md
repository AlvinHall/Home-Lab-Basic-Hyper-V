#Home Lab
##Basic Hyper-V
----------
This collection of scripts is designed to create the virtual machines for a basic Windows Server 2012 home lab built on Windows 8.1 Pro Client Hyper-V. These scripts are not for installing and configuring the Operating Systems.
*These scripts should also work on Windows Hyper-V Server (I'll update this after I have tested)*

This lab requires the following:
- PowerShell v4.0
- Windows 8.1 Pro with the Hyper-V Platform Windows feature enabled
- 60GB of storage

The following is recommended:
- >4GB of memory
- Quad core processor

This set of scripts will create the following servers:
###DC1
- 2 Cores
- 1GB of memory
- 25GB VHDX

###FP1
- 2 Cores
- 1GB of memory
- 25GB VHDX
- 10GB VHDX

Please be kind as this is my first step into using GitHub, or Git for that matter.
